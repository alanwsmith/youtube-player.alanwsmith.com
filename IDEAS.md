# IDEAS

- make a component that prevents flash
of unstyled content. idea is to hard code
css in the page that hide everthing
then have the main body first elemnt
be a component that unhides when everything
is done loading. 

look at :define and
noscript tags and adding a style to
the body for how to do it

look at 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet/ready

set up timers so there isn't
too big a delay in which case you'd
render without fonts and specifically
make sure they don't update the 
page via font-swap


- Make an image alt tag wrapper that
takes the alt text and makes it a button
that you can click on to read it

- Make controls for mp4
